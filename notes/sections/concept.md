This research aims to identify, categorize, and analyze the most frequently occurring conversation patterns within online travel communities, specifically focusing on travel-related subreddits. The study will employ natural language processing and topic modeling techniques to extract meaningful patterns from large-scale conversation data, while also measuring user engagement metrics to determine value creation.

The research will investigate both the quantitative aspects (frequency, engagement metrics, user participation) and qualitative elements (content themes, information quality, problem-solving effectiveness) of these conversations. Special attention will be paid to how certain conversation types contribute to community knowledge building and travel decision-making.

By understanding these patterns, the study aims to develop a framework for identifying high-value travel discussions, which could inform both community moderation strategies and travel information system design.
